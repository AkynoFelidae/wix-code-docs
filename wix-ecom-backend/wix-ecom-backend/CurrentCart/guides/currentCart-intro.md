# Introduction

When a visitor first interacts with your site's cart — such as when they add a product or service — the current cart is created. Once that happens, it can be managed through the Current Cart API.

The Current Cart API differs from the Cart API in that their is no need for a `cart.id` to manage it. All methods in the Current Cart API automatically interact with the site visitor's cart that is currently being used.
