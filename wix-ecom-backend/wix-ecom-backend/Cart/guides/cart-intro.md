# Introduction

The cart is the first phase of a purchase, followed by checkout, then order. Carts can be created, managed, and used [to create a checkout](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-ecom-backend/cart/createcheckout?branch=autodocs-wix-ecom-backend) with the Cart API.

A cart holds information about items for purchase, prices, discounts, site details, and more.

Estimate the cart's totals (including shipping costs) using the [estimateCurrentCartTotals()](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-ecom-backend/currentcart/estimatecurrentcarttotals?branch=autodocs-wix-ecom-backend) function.

To assist in moving from the old [Stores Cart API](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-stores/cart) to the new, please refer to the [cart conversion table](LINK).
