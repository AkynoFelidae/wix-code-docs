# Introduction

The Categories API allows a site visitor to get and query forum categories.
Categories allow you to sort your forum posts into different groups. They give your 
readers a general idea of what your forum posts are about. 


To use the Categories API, import `{ categories }` from the `wix-forum.v2` module:

```javascript
import { categories } from 'wix-forum.v2';
```
