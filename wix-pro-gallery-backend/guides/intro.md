With Wix Pro Gallery Backend API, you can manage your Pro Galleries.

Before working with the ProGallery API, you'll need to add at least on Gallery - for more information see [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-pro-gallery-about-the-wix-pro-gallery).

The Pro Gallery API allow you to:

*   Get, and update Pro Galleries
*   Create, get, update, and delete media items

> **Note**: To work with the ProGallery API, you need to publish your site. APIs working on public data only.

## Terminology
+ **Pro Gallery:** A responsive, and customizable gallery that displays media items.
+ **Media Items:** Images, videos, and text files uploaded to a Pro Gallery. You can read more about [supported media](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-pro-gallery-adding-media-to-the-gallery).

## Sort Order
In order to preserve a defined order of galleries/items, Wix uses the sortOrder field.

* You can update the `sortOrder` field using your own logic using the relevant **Update** endpoint.
* If sortOrder is not given on creation, the `sortOrder` field will automatically be populated with the current timestamp ([Epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)).
* In order to prevent updating the all previous/next items when reordering a single item, the Wix UI uses the following calculation:  
  `new_sortOrder = (next_item.sortOrder + previous_item.sortOrder)/2`

> **Note**: You can choose other forms of logic to reorder items.

## Using the API
To use the ProGallery API, import proGallery from the wix-pro-gallery-backend module:
```javascript 
import proGallery from 'wix-pro-gallery-backend';
```

## Limitations
+ Item can be from type Image, Video or Text.
+ The [onGalleryCreated()](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-pro-gallery-backend/events/ongallerycreated) and [onGalleryUpdated()](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-pro-gallery-backend/events/ongalleryupdated) events don't return the media items included in the gallery. To retrieve these items or their IDs you need to listen to the [onGalleryItemCreated()](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-pro-gallery-backend/events/ongalleryitemcreated) and [onGalleryItemUpdated()](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-pro-gallery-backend/events/ongalleryitemupdated) events in addition.
